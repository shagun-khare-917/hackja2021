    <h1>Calling All Manufacturers!</h1>
    
    <p>  
 As our company’s goal is geared towards helping hospitals keep track of their supply chain management, our target group for 
 defining our profit would be manufacturing companies. Due to several manufacturing companies falling behind on distributing 
 vectors and COVID-19 related supplies to various hospitals, our software would primarily assist these companies in allocating
 these resources properly to the hospitals that need them the most. Our customers would benefit by being able to invest and form
 partnerships with a wider scope of hospitals, allowing them to increase in revenue. Additionally, with the public image, the trust
 score of our customer’s companies would significantly increase as they utilize our software to effectively deliver the supplies on time. 
    </p>
    
   <p>
   	Our plans for expansion are to increase our outreach in both hospitals and manufacturing companies. As our goal is to be able to provide
    and allocate supplies to lower-income hospitals as well, by creating the opportunities for our customers to form new partnerships with these
    hospitals, they would directly result in an increase of revenue. Additionally, as we grow by including more hospitals in our database, the 
    number of manufacturing companies would directly expand as well in order to accommodate for the growing number of hospital’s supply chains.
