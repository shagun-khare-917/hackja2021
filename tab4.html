    <h1>Calling All Manufacturers!</h1>

    <p>  
    As our company’s goal is geared towards helping hospitals keep track of their supply chain management, our target group for 
    defining our profit would be manufacturing companies. Due to several manufacturing companies falling behind on distributing 
    vectors and COVID-19 related supplies to various hospitals, our software would primarily assist these companies in allocating
    these resources properly to the hospitals that need them the most. Our customers would benefit by being able to invest and form
    partnerships with a wider scope of hospitals, allowing them to increase in revenue. Additionally, with the public image, the trust
    score of our customer’s companies would significantly increase as they utilize our software to effectively deliver the supplies on time. 
    </p>
    
   <p>
   	Our plans for expansion are to increase our outreach in both hospitals and manufacturing companies. As our goal is to be able to provide
    and allocate supplies to lower-income hospitals as well, by creating the opportunities for our customers to form new partnerships with these
    hospitals, they would directly result in an increase of revenue. Additionally, as we grow by including more hospitals in our database, the 
    number of manufacturing companies would directly expand as well in order to accommodate for the growing number of hospital’s supply chains.

    Our top priority is to support and properly supply every hospital in our system. That’s right. By adding a hospital in our database,
    we guarantee that any supplies that the hospital is in short of will be delivered with care and on time. Our AI-driven technology is 
    built in order to keep track of every hospital’s track record of available supplies, and will support our manufacturing companies 
    immediately in order to safely and securely deliver the supplies to the patients. Not only do we take pride in our software, but our 
    sole purpose is to provide for every hospital in need. With our inclusiviity policy, all low-income hospitals are fully supported through
    our database of manufacturing companies. Last, but certainly not least, we display our information on a real-time basis, with all our records
    recorded. Therefore, we ensure you full product capacity of all the supplies you order.
