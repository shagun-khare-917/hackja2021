Hospitals are filled with people, and resources are dwindling. This is especially true in the case of low financed and economically disadvantaged community health centers. Many of these centers donâ€™t necessarily have the ability to get more resources to help their patients. So, we have taken it upon ourselves to create our startup, (NAME), which would use Artificial Intelligence to prioritize and rank hospitals/health centers based on how urgently they require resources. Manufacturers will then consult us and send resources to the prioritized centers along with their usual business. This will help manufacturing companies earn a little extra money during this time of economic lows, and it will help economically disadvantaged hospitals care for the people who need it. Lives will be saved, and it will be a win-win situation for all. </p>
